In 2012, Red Hat launched its first mobile related research project, titled
[AeroGear]. AeroGear's goal is to provide flexible, extensible libraries and
server side components that simplify mobile development and infrastructure setup
across platforms.

In December 2015, the [UnifiedPush Server] from the AeroGear project was
integrated into FeedHenry. This provides FeedHenry users the ability to
send push notifications to any device, regardless of platform or network.

#### Overview

RainCatcher modules are packaged and distributed via [npm]. They are designed to
be included in your application using [Browserify]. RainCatcher modules export
one or more of:

* [Angular.js 1] directives or services providing client-side functionality for
both the mobile and portal clients.
* [Express.js] routes providing a REST API to be consumed by the client-side
portions of the module.
* FeedHenry sync configurations for enabling data synchronization of a module's
data. Each module's README file includes more detail on its purpose and how to
use it.

#### FAQ

###### What's the release cycle for RainCatcher?

We have not yet developed a schedule for releases. RainCatcher is still in rapid
development, and we're going to be working with the larger community to develop
a cadence.

###### What's the relationship between RainCatcher and RHMAP WFM?

RainCatcher is the upstream project for WFM, where we do work before pulling
it into our supported product. Features in RainCatcher may or may not ultimately
land in WFM.

###### I'd like to contribute, do I need to sign a CLA?

No, we do not have a CLA for RainCatcher, but contributors do acknowledge that
work contributed to RainCatcher is their own work and they have the right to
